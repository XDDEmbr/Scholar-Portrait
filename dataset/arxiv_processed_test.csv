704.0001,"  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

704.0003,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

704.0006,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with
tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair
wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

704.0007,"  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

704.0008,"  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

704.0009,"  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy
observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

704.0017,"  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya
in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their

ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a

704.0023,"  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,
remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock

704.0033,"  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are
bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.

for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain,
using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar
form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger
than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es

show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the

blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the

of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy

704.0044,"  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined

of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical

704.0069,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

704.008,"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way
depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the

clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

704.0085,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses

Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such
as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated
oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be
the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate
superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including
the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects,
the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We
show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these
arguments are not well founded.

We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.
{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a
total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move
with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter
$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le

twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit
the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon
bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon
scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark
(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the
ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)
distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark
distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and
antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively
explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron
suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark

studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H
between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V
isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show
a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down
to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in
terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may
be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.
Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled
according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent
effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate
accurate light curves rapidly.
  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data

704.0138,"  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a
nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf

circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum

vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including

to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the

Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,
though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.

(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings

kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)
the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the

span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally

704.0154,"  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium
selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we
demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of
the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;
more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any
mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral
functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay
branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a
quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be
part of any reliable theory.

after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling
down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these

generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give
rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed

complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed
for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the
entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of
experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to
integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and
information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of
the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments

704.0164,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type

704.0187,"  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of
the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,

that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,

holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating

longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In

out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct

704.0217,"  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than

704.0229,"  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

704.023,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the
description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the
diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be
identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type
in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic
observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16

to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass

  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active

nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent molecular
dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two
approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent
conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be
corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or
collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and
fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction
accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover
scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit
modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in
nonequilibrium.

704.024,"  We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to
finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic
behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation
functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we
formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond
to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide
a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of
theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture.
Possible implications for real systems are mentioned.

dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations
(non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and
incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation
is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the
bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are
calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond
Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows
momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order
is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to
Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.

antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is
based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional
Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent
solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then
analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these
quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and
also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found
to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf

perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in
one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain

give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms.
These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator,
introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations
of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our
proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the

704.0248,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the
self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.
Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under
which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.
Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site

color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are
varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated

formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main
predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical
perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the
evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require
better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

704.0261,"  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak
lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of

704.0267,"  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF.
The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of
neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with
previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.
(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =
9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis
patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day

704.027,"  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of
planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

704.028,"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the
envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the

models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some

704.0296,"  A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is
constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping
them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations
among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not
equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these
systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of
twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical
applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.
Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A
unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in
the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the
dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in
high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as
well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper

704.0297,"  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen
(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these

network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering

(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,

uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include

704.0321,"  We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material
using state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.
To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where
SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence
states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti
substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.
This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity
in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based

entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having

non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in

The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of

dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,

conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and

The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial

approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations

Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of
visible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six
families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5
cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The
sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception
of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and
P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the
exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is
detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type
asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property
distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in
comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.
Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher
inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.

704.0351,"  Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a
sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The
sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics
of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or
possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made
using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,
5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are
presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of
the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a
complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One
of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and
infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object
whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The
young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution
scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux
of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.

of the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When
both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for
isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper

equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,
besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular
momentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or
lower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few

704.0355,"  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.
(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses
undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode
deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications
for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable
amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.

704.0357,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a

low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a

performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to

analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result
for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$
the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic
field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of
$3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We
speculate on the observable implications of this effect.

to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the

one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy

of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an
$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this

704.0389,"  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits
around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the
photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the
absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for
oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is

equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the
correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.
By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and
taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or
for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the

accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the

Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the

(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the
dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0

I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional
conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The
n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are

704.0438,"  The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open
up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed
neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs
boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are
subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic
decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.
A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced
vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed
using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel
decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental
constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question
of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the
approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.

704.0441,"  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD
70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and
F-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients,
used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to
deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally
compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea
explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand
unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,
the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model
fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex
structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the
arbitrariness of their relative positions.

only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model

present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\

the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and
use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale
structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of
these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in

704.0467,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its

composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a

inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.

there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases

heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental

suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive

another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions

Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through

resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved

IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains

that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar

us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

704.0528,"  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,
one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic

variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &

with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.

become directly observable at low energies.

inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of
bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which

interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This
problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the
system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both
energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a
hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the
algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD
simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within
experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box
should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.
It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.

704.057,"  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been
expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling

measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that

704.0586,"  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of
grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of

running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the

due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the

These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then

The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200

spectropolarimetric observations of the 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sun
region near a decaying active region and compare the results with a simulation

pairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close,
often do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topology
is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the
phase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that
Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the
observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the

Ca II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar to
those in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in the

704.0619,"  The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. We
analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs
bosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by
combining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on
full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM
Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios
in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM
parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM
Higgs bosons at the LHC.

distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by

conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.

define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The

signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the

ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced

new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5

us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with

loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright

704.0645,"  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk
surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the
optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable
property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme
length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,
whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to
near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain
scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a
large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in
the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics
alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical
perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115
that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic
space velocity, and age.

704.0647,"  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB
observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.

704.0648,"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

704.0652,"  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths
of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS
Stripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz
system for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we
compute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and
study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter
than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g
and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)
quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted
flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar
locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like
behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo
substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to
expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that
it will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million

field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray
background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and
the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible
range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to
radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the
heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to
constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the
observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)

density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-

suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the

models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive
helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during
core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few
millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent
evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the

expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included
here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of

LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the
partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a

the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon

704.0671,"  The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random
variable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an
i.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable
predictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach
asymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the
class. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the
$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some
finite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the
$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,
the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we
give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor
performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are
illustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.

Friedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variable
equation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant
$\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing
1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the
equation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass
object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the
scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant
mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$
cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds
to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into
account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized
straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the

704.0673,"  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal
transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational
neuroscience and electronics.

investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with

modes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, it
is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only

procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\""{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include

existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the

704.0698,"  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston
separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit
mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging
techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.
  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons
separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of
averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging
results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem
for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.

have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data

means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude

shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this

it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient

we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of

suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

704.0725,"  When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is
rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the
transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by
extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We
find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating
medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular
momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum
account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of
the transmitted image.

positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also

704.073,"  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the

equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is
the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be

found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much
larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more

reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and

Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm

the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental

704.0758,"  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled
state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate

velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the

moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to

activities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN

nature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the
Unified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this
article is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the

markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations
in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging
market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to
developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to
be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.

the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent
classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to
local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription
of Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes

cataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of
cataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample
of close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic
variables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic
white dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,
would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are
similar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average
field strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of
these systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.
Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic
white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the
properties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the
presumed close binary progenitors.

704.0791,"  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also

-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift

704.0792,"  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the
correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

704.0796,"  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that
recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

704.0799,"  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the
spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the
quantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a

suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the

from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,
called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of
the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion
star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.
In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with
particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The

0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained
medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian

1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in
flux stars of unknown colour.

produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are

$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the
mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$
color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,
interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for
2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are
respectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$
and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only
pure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger
than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions
entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or
$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will
manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D

this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly

a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the

advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance

704.089,"  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants
(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some

investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the
sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a

resonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance
strengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than
our estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%

chain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the

proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost
similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with
a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap
which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the
energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level

grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a

tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the

the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their

increase media density without causing thermal instability

Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of
the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching
field, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2
for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches
have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this
formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can
be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess

better constraints for planet-formation models.
  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital
solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The

fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a

orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.
The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal

prove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.
This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As
an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0

conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

704.0927,"  Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averages
over a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functions
Ratios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many
problems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and
moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing
agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;
however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.
These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios
Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We
test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic
family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental
discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate
all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect
agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show
agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this
family and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios
Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.

supergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitative
agreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis
abundances, and recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The
carrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence
field slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is
a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold
dark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the
quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).
However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold
dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter
energy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of
supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure
constant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)
``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)
the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a
Robertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,
we present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensional

their absolute B-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclear
activity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-type
galaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006). We find that the fraction
of disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large
sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear
relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the
isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations
between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the
optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group
hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be
accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy
luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,
nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape
of early-type galaxies.

704.0932,"  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large
N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed

algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding
and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with
radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean
hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to

better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular

no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular

the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in

found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and
~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained
due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such

spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the
average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon
l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)
power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03

the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

704.0954,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In

and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or

704.0968,"  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for
planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the
lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we
consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim

704.097,"  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of
protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150

young energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant
G54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra
X-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms
pulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution
shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise
and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$
modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$
duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed
emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =
1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The
total 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.

704.0979,"  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in
the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the
ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric

Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases

The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is

dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core

multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the

704.1016,"  Motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on
La-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin
susceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of
La-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for
Y-based and La-based cuprates.

704.1018,"  Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the
range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over
trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the
excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant
($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by
several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$
without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be
explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron
interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can
be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm
env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We
also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate
the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and
$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235

to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that
the ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the
uniaxial-stress-induced shift.

704.102,"  The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of
partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are
modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a
possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the
universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact

investigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toral
equivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of
M admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author
shows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one
packings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In
contrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are
uncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a
maximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis
of how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given
symplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that
are equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.

charge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an
r^{-4} dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the
characteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than
the characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the
application of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the
interaction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by
introducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave
scattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe
trap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational
states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to
quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit
confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for
short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the
effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which
occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we
show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control
and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules.

acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all

particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can
approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable

704.1044,"  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter
field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter

that advocated by these authors. I show that my results are independent of all

(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in
the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT
results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the
Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated
by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant

704.1066,"  We investigate degenerate saddle point problems, which can be viewed as limit
cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in
coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the
degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the
right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The
LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the
problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other
assumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the
positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation
for research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric
problems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of
the jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite
materials made of components with contrasting properties.

704.1067,"  We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a
very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,
where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is
only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular
clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at
orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on
the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in
globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch
stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in
forming low mass white dwarfs.

704.1079,"  Recently it has been shown that string instanton effects may give rise to
neutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string
compactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric

associated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-
and/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane
instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only
instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to
contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of
fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold
compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries
to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with
MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the
required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other
hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner
model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged
non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints
on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting
property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in

based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral

signal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.
More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}
visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show
that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim
10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA
will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total
mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency
cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$
$(\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical
viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this
mass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black
holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the

704.1088,"  Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function $f (\bm{r} \pm
\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either
$\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is
the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

$Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is
true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in
$T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of
inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In
particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent
of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is
finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are
products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the
group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or
$\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in
$\rU(n)$. The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits
of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known,

trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques.
Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic
horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is
triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach
resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static
for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The
characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the
horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is
estimated to be a few nK.

range (M$_*$$\sim$2--8 M$_\odot$). High spatial resolution studies of IM young
stellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering
in massive star forming regions.
  Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high
spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these
nearby objects.
  Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396
N, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have
been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the
clustering process on the luminosity of the source.
  Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low
luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two
compact sources separated by $\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which
provides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is
splitted in, at least, three individual sources.

out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be

this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)

a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the
spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function
depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>
10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\sim
80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray
sources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk
temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the
lower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known
background AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed
$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The
spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black
body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct

hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures
$\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk
temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they

stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young
star-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the

LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation
scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample
contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be
~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs

evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be

monitored for a period of five years (1997-2003), using a small array of
scintillation detectors in Tehran, Iran. The data have been analyzed to take in
to account of the dependence of source counts on zenith angle. Because of
varying thickness of the overlaying atmosphere, the shower count rate is
extremely dependent on zenith angle. During a calendar year different sources
come in the field of view of the array at varying zenith angles and have
different effective observation time equivalent to zenith in a day. High energy
gamma-ray sources from the EGRET third catalogue where observed and the data
were analyzed using an excess method. Upper limits were obtained for 10 EGRET
sources. Then we investigated the EAS event rates for these 10 sources and
obtained a flux for each of them using parameters of our experiment results and

704.1123,"  The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating
applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,
\partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.

(HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in an area bounded by l = 60 & 180 deg, b =

by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of
intermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest
peaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is

the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close
examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of
diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity
cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft
X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is
suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission
observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one
another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of
enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible
that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary

704.1127,"  The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles
of the H I Ly-$\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar
coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large
scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona
at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered
observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the
velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as
previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...

identified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933,
HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of
3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS
0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)
h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS
0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital
period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.

the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens
to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this

to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant
step-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models
can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.
Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large
class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this

704.114,"  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods
the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.

these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the

plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

reaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's
framework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to
extended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar
model, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show
how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and
then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further
enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less
trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After
discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from
it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective
scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by
the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we
find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.

704.1149,"  When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,
the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of
the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the
self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for
GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the
evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the
source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration
of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a
radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge
between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated
GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave
distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in
numerical simulations.

704.1151,"  We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),
reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for
twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between
~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different
parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed

704.1155,"  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely
noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

flux. The Spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum of
the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.
However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}

we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view
of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the

dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The

$\lambda + \sum_{k = 1}^d [\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s are
linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients
of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \emph{multipole}
vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of
polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,
real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not
unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the
combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some
classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions
of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical
theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator
$\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are
constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce
modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology
using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole
spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to
the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where
$\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.

breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty

used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be
very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89
Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties

Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to
the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by
exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a
new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous
evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and
Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up
locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the
resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in
the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for
the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.
If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or
reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,
this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We
discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in
Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital
architecture of the giant planets and the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment

704.1215,"  Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low
orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars
received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case
of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the
electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary
systems, and not in single stars.

704.1218,"  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the
strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)

The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.

$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude
of the Stokes vector $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to
one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring
monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and
$\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta =

relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite
different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger

704.1237,"  High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is
reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR
4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and
several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the
near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission
through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.
The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the
spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be
circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the
previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line
profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer
near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and
the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar
and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity
of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar
abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance
winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the

require that the surface gravity approaches to zero, and it is easy to
understand the Legendre transformation of f, the integration of Lagrangian

Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The
observations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480
days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was
calibrated through the S-correction technique.
  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble
those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)
mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988
(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of
standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three
methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance
modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR
bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies
that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.
Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the
range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and
NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II
ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the
blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum
spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K

previously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We
detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the
other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without
ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all

candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and

(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance

dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a

dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry

704.1256,"  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in
nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy
cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating
operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard
Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,
quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the
electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These
requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic
heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a
U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of
left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.
The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future
experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton
decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension
four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number
violating operators and R-parity violation.

exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory

704.1269,"  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random
graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

704.1275,"  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for
chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like
oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some

704.1278,"  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is
transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

704.1289,"  The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is
extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The
exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference,
allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The
quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by
the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's
differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can
be tested by current experiments in astrophysics and by near future laboratory
experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss
problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of

finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident
D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin
chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the
non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge
field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory.
For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green
functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We
discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond
linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical
potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.

704.1297,"  We present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of Swift
and XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) GRB 050730. The
X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed
intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude
in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks
after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well
described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s
and t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and
after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)
and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray
afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an
absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.
Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the
majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the
event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.
We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three
flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as
expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed
shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow
moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The
event fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with
the E_p-E_jet Ghirlanda relation.

704.1301,"  We present high-resolution, multiwavelength continuum and molecular-line
images of the massive star forming region IRAS 18317-0757. The IR through mm
spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25
and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous
submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which
is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.
In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with
total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA
cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in
the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature
of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and
interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores
in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type

  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the

mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.
  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This
is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are

(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to
transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter
has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel
feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining
because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization
of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to
quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user

This gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at

interaction of the nucleobases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine
(T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional
theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree--Fock plus
second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy
of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the
equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results
clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different
interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in
the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by
the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force
to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step
towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can
affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.

704.1318,"  We present a deep photometric survey of M31, conducted with the CFHT and INT,
covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,
and extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very
outermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale
structures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of
substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile
between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is
particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting
results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a
faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least
150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a
Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger
than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-
0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is
similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying
halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected
from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended
metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of
scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a
challenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]

704.132,"  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract
information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical
correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated
in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string
theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,
we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet
tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level
heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

704.1324,"  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew
adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent
limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

introducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes
photodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino
opacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas

compute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron
fraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion

opaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of

704.1328,"  Diffuse emission is produced in energetic cosmic ray (CR) interactions,
mainly protons and electrons, with the interstellar gas and radiation field and
contains the information about particle spectra in distant regions of the
Galaxy. It may also contain information about exotic processes such as dark
matter annihilation, black hole evaporation etc. A model of the diffuse
emission is important for determination of the source positions and spectra.
Calculation of the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission requires a
model for CR propagation as the first step. Such a model is based on theory of
particle transport in the interstellar medium as well as on many kinds of data
provided by different experiments in Astrophysics and Particle and Nuclear
Physics. Such data include: secondary particle and isotopic production cross
sections, total interaction nuclear cross sections and lifetimes of radioactive
species, gas mass calibrations and gas distribution in the Galaxy (H_2, H I, H

at the sources, magnetic field, energy losses, gamma-ray and synchrotron

704.1329,"  Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of high
energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and
derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the
prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared
within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high
energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux
level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these
photons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.

and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is
definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,
it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow
for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was
obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical
evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were
determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and
distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass
function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation
effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study
reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42
observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed
clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.
The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is
3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's
mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical
evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is
similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of
evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass
segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the
dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.
Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5

those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the
host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.
Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.
  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.
Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a
determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a
dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.
  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars
selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the
radial velocities and spectral analyses.
  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates
analysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence
none of the five transiting objects is a planet.

temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite
critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing
the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit
states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters
concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a
mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this
characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and
magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit
Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model
exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In
addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical
property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses
properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most
importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB
concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of
our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it
is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any

is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and
message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,
Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks

resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than
10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared
adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is
unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the
nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -
starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few
percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the
luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a
similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to
10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density
exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited
and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in
multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset
of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether
this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in
fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and
supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.
On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,

704.1384,"  This paper deals with a family of spatial rational curves that were
introduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an
algorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational
parametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when
possible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of
the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,
and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the
${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension
$\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation
$\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.
  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of
the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,
via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a
suitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at
infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of
circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the
dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many
${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.
Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation
of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of
curves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the
simplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.

galactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster
extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the
core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by
mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the
cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall
population.

transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison

galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified

the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with
the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the

704.1406,"  We use a third-order perturbation theory and Melnikov's method to prove the
existence of chaos in spinning circular disks subject to a lateral point load.
We show that the emergence of transverse homoclinic and heteroclinic points
respectively lead to a random reversal in the traveling direction of
circumferential waves and a random phase shift of magnitude $\pi$ for both
forward and backward wave components. These long-term phenomena occur in
imperfect low-speed disks sufficiently far from fundamental resonances.

704.1407,"  Recently it was demonstrated (Schattschneider et al., Nature 441 (2006),
486), that an analogue of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
experiment can be performed with the transmission electron microscope (TEM).
The new phenomenon has been named energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD).
In this work we present a detailed ab initio study of the chiral dichroism in
the Fe, Co and Ni transition elements. We discuss the methods used for the
simulations together with the validity and accuracy of the treatment, which
can, in principle, apply to any given crystalline specimen. The dependence of
the dichroic signal on the sample thickness, accuracy of the detector position
and the size of convergence and collection angles is calculated.

704.1408,"  We analyse a series of pilot observations in order to study microlensing of
(unresolved) stars in M31 with the 1.5m Loiano telescope, including
observations on both identified variable source stars and reported microlensing
events. We also look for previously unknown variability and discover a nova. We
discuss an observing strategy for an extended campaign with the goal of
determining whether MACHOs exist or whether all microlensing events are
compatible with lens stars in M31.
